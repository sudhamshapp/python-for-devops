# collection of functions is called module and collection of modules is called package/library
# if your code is written in multiple python files, we can bundle these files into a package/library
# this is the modular approach
# we can use the desired function as well as all the functions
# we can also import one particular module from a functions
# import demo as arbitary
# arbitary #it calls all the modules in a file
# arbitary.add() # it calls the add function in demo.py

import demo
# demo
demo.add() #we get all the stuff because in demo function, we are invoking all the functions and printing the functions

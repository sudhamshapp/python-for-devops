github api docs - https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28

convert the json to dictionaries in python

if we wanna store the list of dictionaries, we use list data structure


get the PRs information on a repo using python, we gonna use the k8s repo for this

we can interact with any tools using the cli(kubectl for k8s and aws s3 ls for s3) and api

requests module
using the request module we can make a API call(get the url to make a API call for pull requests)
convert json to a dictionary, because python won't perform operations directly on dictionaries, it perform the operationa on native data structures, dictionary is the closest one
print the stuff
